    introduction: "You work for a large retailer. Every Friday a charismatic leader sends out a video message to his employees. These videos are uploaded to Microsoft Streams (part of O365). Streams uses machine learning to transcribe videos into text.\n\nOn this particular Friday a window opens on your desktop (just like in a rubbish film from the 90s). The doors around you lock. Shutters drop down (a bit like something from Terminator 2). The window contains the following text:\n\n---Hello valued employee. I am one of your former colleagues. You laughed when I said Sharknado was my favourite film, and sniggered when I described it as a 'tour-de-force'. In order to get my revenge I have scrambled the transcription of this week's video message. The answer to my challenges is the name of a screenplay I am working on which will take Hollywood by storm. If you don't unscramble the message and enter the name of my screenplay within 45 minutes I will make your terminal play Sharknado extremely loudly for the next 6 hours. --- \n\nThe window has a file attached - see the Teams Chat for this meeting for a copy.\n\nLuckily, the transcript is still valid JSON. However some extra characters have been added into some of the words, including some non-English ones, and the entries in the transcription are out of order. \n\nThe hacker has demanded that you enter a phrase by completing the challenges below:",
    finalAnswer: "The Shredderman from Buntingford"

# Tasks

## Task 1
For each of the first two digits in the total number of words, get the first letter in the film title at the index of that digit in this list:

https://www.imdb.com/list/ls064202652/

For example: if there were 674 words, the first two digits are 6 and 7.
The films as position 6 and 7 in the list are "Elite Squad 2: The Enemy Within" and "Yogi Bear"
The answer for the first task would therefore be "Elite Yogi".

## Task 2
Find the penultimate word from the last element in the array.

## Task 3
Find the third word of the second element in the array
