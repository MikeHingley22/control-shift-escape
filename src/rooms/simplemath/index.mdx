# Tasks

## Task 1
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, for instance, to add 3 and 4, you would write 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4. If there are multiple operations, operators are given immediately after their second operands; so the expression written 3 − 4 + 5 in conventional notation would be written as 3 4 − 5 + in Reverse Polish Notation (4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it). An advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix notation, for example 2 x (3 + 4) in RPN will be written as 2 3 4 + x. 

Your task is to calculate the following expression: 4 2 4 8 * + 9 8 * 3 / * * 

## Task 2
This task is very simple. You just need to add three numbers. The only difficulty is that numbers are written in Roman numerals and the result should be translated to arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). 

Expression to calculate is MMMDCCXXIV + MMCXLVII + DCLXXV

## Task 3
The least common denominator (LCD) is the smallest number that can be a common denominator for a set of fractions. Also known as the lowest common denominator, it is the lowest number you can use in the denominator to create a set of equivalent fractions that all have the same denominator. 

Find the LCD of 1/2, 6/8, 5/7, 7/9, 1/3
