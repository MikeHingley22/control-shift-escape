    introduction: "Each of the tasks in this room gives a numeric answer, which will then be used for the final puzzle. The time limit gives approximately 5 minutes per task, but some tasks are easier than others - you may be able to escape without completing all of the tasks if you can still solve the final puzzle. All the information you should need is on this page, either in the task description itself or in the reference sheets for the task.",

# Tasks

## Task 1
Let's begin with a simple challenge by finding how many words in this sentence contain the letter e (bearing in mind that the letter e by itself doesn't count).

## Task 2
An isogram is a word which contains no duplicate letters (not necessarily next to each other) - 'large' is an isogram but 'small' and 'medium' aren't. Find the largest number in the following list which is an isogram:

one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen

## Task 3
The expression below has been scrambled using a transposition cypher: the original expression was written out and broken into rows of six letters, and then the columns were read in order from top to bottom to generate the output. For example, NUMBER PUZZLE would become NMEPZL UBRUZE. Unscramble the expression to find the answer.

## Task 4
A Fibonacci Prime number is, as the name suggests, a Fibonacci number (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5...) which is also prime (number greater than 1 which is only divisible by 1 and itself). Find the fourth Fibonacci Prime.

## Task 5
Find the smallest sum of digits from the numbers in the following list (e.g. the sum of digits for 34 is 7):

9, 25, 41, 60, 78

This task contains hidden Morse code. Morse code - for those who haven't seen it before - is a method of encoding text into a series of dots and dashes, which can then be used to communicate by any means of sight or sound - for example, by flashing a light or making a loud noise - and the use of sight/sound means that messages can be communicated over a long distance. In addition to dots and dashes, a forward slash can sometimes be used to split up characters. The text in this task contains a number, given in Morse code. You must find the Morse code and then convert it to get the answer. The reference sheet should help with decyphering.

## Task 7
The word below has been shifted using a ROT13 ('rotate by 13 places') cypher, where each letter has been replaced by the 13th letter after it e.g. the letter A would shift to the letter N. A ROT13 cypher is its own inverse - shifting the letter N using ROT13 would return the letter A again. Shift the word below to find the answer.

## Task 8
The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest integer which divides both numbers - the greatest common divisor of 8 and 12 is 4. Find the greatest common divisor of 160 and 540.

# Final Puzzle
Convert the answer from each task to a letter (1=A, 2=B, etc.) to get the final answer.
